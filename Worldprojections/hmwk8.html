<h1>Homework 8: Census Data Ratios and Categories </h1>
<h2>Maeve Goldberg</h2>
<br>
<h3> For these maps I used data of how many women had given birth in the last 12 months in each New Jersey county and compared it to the county population data to create the percent of the county population that had given birth in the last year. I wanted to use that ratio because the first choropleth map that I created showed only the number of women who had given birth, which was basically just a map of where most people live in New Jersey. With this ratio however you can actaully compare across counties to see where more women have given birth. To categroize the data in my maps I used three different classifications: natural break, pretty break, and equal interval.</h3>

<h2>Natural Breaks Classification</h2>
    <h3>The natrual breaks classification is a good choice becauses its classficiations reflects the data, however, it is not the best choice for classification if you want to do analysis based on specific critera.</h3>

<h2>Pretty Breaks Classification</h2>
<h3>The pretty breaks classification is interesting to use because it rounds the data categories to the nearest tenth which is easy for a layperson to understand. However if you wanted to see certain data points not rounded up or down then pretty breaks would not be the best choice.</h3>

<h2>Equal Interval Classification</h2>
 <h3>Equal interval classfication is a usful tool that creates classes increasing by the same value, which could be helpful if there was a speicifc metric you wanted to classes composed of for your analysis. A downside of equal interval classification is that you can't really see the distribution of you data if your intervals are too small or large.</h3>
